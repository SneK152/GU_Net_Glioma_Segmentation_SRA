GU-Net: Diffuse Glioma Segmentation in Brain MRIs Using a Modified U-Net under Data Constraints

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dschettler8845/brats-2021-task1

Diffuse gliomas account for nearly 80% of all malignant brain tumors in adults and often require precise surgical treatment. Our model, caled GU-Net is trained to segemnt gliomas from brain MRIs an The proposed model is trained on a subset of the BraTS 2021 dataset, consisting of a mere 1647 images stemming from 549 different brain MRIs.
